An exploration into Flask with SQLAlchemy. 
The use cases where SQLAlchemy has advantages over Flask-SQLAlchemy Module

"Another disadvantage is that Flask-SQLAlchemy makes using the database outside of a Flask context difficult. This is because, with Flask-SQLAlchemy, the database connection, models, and app are all located within the app.py file. Having models within the app file, we have limited ability to interact with the database outside of the app. This makes loading data outside of your app difficult. Additionally, this makes it hard to retrieve data outside of the Flask context."
